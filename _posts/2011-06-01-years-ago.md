In a blur long long ago I decided to pursue something. I wrote about it [on blogger][blogger-link] when the web 2.0 was exploding. For now I am trying to <!--more-->figure out a work flow but those of you who have read the ancient post I just reached a halfway point and have exciting things to begin blogging. This is going to happen here where I can learn more about [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and exercise working more with git and ruby.

#Starting
my goal is to record all the steps I take to get to this point of having a jekyll site hosted on github.

first for development and testing I an m creating a vagrant file
not sure if this going to be in the repo or not

so far I (on a windows machine:
```
mkdir jekyllvag
cd jekyllvag
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Looks good so far. I am guessing that I will be creating a shell script to provision this damn thing to handle jekyll. Maybe I will search for a jekyll ready box. 
Well I followed an example of provision script and added my custom box settings.
booted up and ran jekyll new
so here i go...

Found an old sitemap plan
